Hey team, welcome to SparkleShare! So far everything is looking pretty good and I'm on my first trial run between two clients.

Edited document in Ubuntu_Client1 VM appeared in bacastil VM. It was successful but the notifications take a little while to pop up, need to look into that. Document edited in my VM appeared in the client VM, success!!!

That's it for today!
